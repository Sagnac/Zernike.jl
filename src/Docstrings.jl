`Zernike.Wavefront`

Callable type: function `ΔW(ρ, θ)` bound to a given set of Zernike polynomial functions `Zᵢ(ρ, θ)` and their corresponding expansion coefficients `aᵢ`.

Specifically, `ΔW(ρ, θ)` = `∑aᵢZᵢ(ρ, θ)`

The single argument method `ΔW(ρ)` will radially evaluate the polynomials with angle zero.

Fields:

* `recap`: vector of named tuples containing the Zernike polynomial indices and the corresponding expansion coefficients;
* `v`: full vector of the unfiltered full-precision standardized expansion coefficients up to `n_max`;
* `n_max`: maximum radial degree fit to;

* `Z`: the respective Zernike polynomial functions;
* `precision`: the precision with which the `a` & `Z` values were determined;
* `ssr`: the sum of the squared residuals from the fit.

The `fit_to` field is an empty vector if the default full range up to `n_max` (`0:j_max`) was used with no `orders` specified. Note that these orders could differ from the polynomials determined after the fit; they are simply what was passed to the fitting function and may refer to polynomials not present in the reconstruction if after filtering the corresponding coefficients are zero.
